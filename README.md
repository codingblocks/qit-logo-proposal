# QIT Logo Proposal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2 and [ng-tailwindcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-tailwindcss) version 1.1.2.

## To run locally

1. `npm i -g ng-tailwindcss` if you don't already have it installed.
2. `npm i` for dependencies.
3. `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## The Logo

[Dave Follett](https://github.com/davefollett) is the mastermind behind the logo design, and the initial code for the svg was put together by [Ben Steward](https://github.com/tehpsalmist).
This svg logo was coded by hand, so by all means dabble in the code and submit a PR if you think something can be tweaked.

_Please note that the `<style>` tag is there on purpose, so anyone who loads the svg on their page can access the secondary background color through the CSS variable with ease. This is primarily to allow the user (dev) to keep the backgrounds unified if they are not white, which may be preferable in some people's opinions. The way this svg is structured, the inner-icon areas couldn't be set to transparent. If you think you can fix this, have at it. I personally think it looks rather cool depending on the color scheme. --Ben_
